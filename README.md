# Motion2Text ‚úçÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüìù

Convert your hand gestures in the air to digital notes using AI! Motion2Text combines **OpenCV** for motion tracking, **Google Cloud Vision AI** for handwriting recognition, and the **Evernote API** for seamless note-taking.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Air Writing Detection**: Track colored markers or objects in real-time using OpenCV
- **AI-Powered Text Conversion**: Leverage GCP's Vision AI to transcribe handwritten gestures
- **Smart Note Management**: Save results as text or images directly to Evernote
- **Customizable Workflow**: Choose between text notes or image uploads

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
| Component       | Technology Used | Purpose |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Motion Tracking | OpenCV (cv2) | Detects and traces colored objects in webcam feed |
| Text Recognition | Google Cloud Vision AI | Converts captured writing to digital text |
| Note Storage | Evernote API | Organizes transcriptions in your Evernote notebooks |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Motion Capture**: The system tracks a specified colored object through your webcam
2. **Preprocessing**: Applies erosion/dilation to clean the input signal
3. **AI Conversion**: Captured gestures are sent to GCP Vision AI for handwriting recognition
4. **Note Creation**: Results are automatically saved to your Evernote account
